# MRInference Machine Learning Tutorial

Welcome!

In this repository you will find the resources for the practical session on machine learning of the MRInference Winter School.

You are welcome (encouradge!) to browse the contents of the repository before the practical session. Have a look at the data and try the code for yourself.
All you need is a Google account.

You can find the entire Python script above (as .py and .ipynb files), but for a more interactive learning experience, I recommend that you open the tutorial in Google Colab. [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sandramv/MRInference_ML_Tutorial/blob/master/Scripts/MRInference_Machine_Learning_Tutorial.ipynb)

### On the day of the practical, please use the colab link to open the code.
